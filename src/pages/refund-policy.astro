			<p>
				At ImgTools, we strive to offer high-quality image processing services and ensure customer
				satisfaction. However, we understand that there may be circumstances where a refund is
				requested. Please review our refund policy carefully.
			</p>
			<h2>1. Digital Product Refunds (Credits/Packages)</h2>
			<p>
				ImgTools offers Packages as digital products. These Packages contain Credits, which are
				required to access and use our various image processing functions, including but not limited
				to Editor, Beautifier, Rounded, and Compressor. By purchasing any of these Packages, users
				agree to the terms outlined in this refund policy.
			</p>
			<h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
			<p>
				Refund requests must be submitted within 14 calendar days from the transaction date. If the
				user has not used any of the purchased Credits, a full refund will be considered. However,
				if any portion of the Credits has been used, no refund will be given. ImgTools does not
				provide partial or prorated refunds under any circumstances.
			</p>
